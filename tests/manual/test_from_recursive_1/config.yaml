# From can be abused as much as you like
# Essentially it just initializes your object before you modify it
# with your configuration file (respecting merge options)

# The order of applying 'from' is as follows:
# for each key, value in dictionary (with or without 'from' key)
# apply this procedure to value.
# Then initialize result to the first object in 'from' list,
# or return the current object if there are no objects in 'from'.
# Then sequentially merge all objects in from[1:] to the result,
# followed by the current object (one that contained 'from' key).
